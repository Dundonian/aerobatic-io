# Getting Started

Aerobatic's goal is to get you up and running in 5 minutes or less. First off
you're going to need node.js. If you don't already have that, head on over to
http://nodejs.org and install it for your platform.

Ok, now that you've got node installed, next we need the yoke command line tool.
You'll be using it constantly when developing on the Aerobatic platform to run
your local simulator server, push new versions to the cloud, execute unit tests,
and more. Installation is a breeze with npm (which was installed as part of
node).

'''bash
yoke install -g aerobatic-yoke
'''
